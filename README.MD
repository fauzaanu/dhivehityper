# Simple vanilla app to practice Thaana typing

## Why?

This project will eventually be added into lessonfuse.com once it is complete.

# How to improve

The wordlist needs more words but not too much. Just enough to cover the keyboard in a distanced combination to provide enough practice.

# How to run

Its just html and javascript.

# Libraries used

Keymap was taken from:
https://github.com/aharen/thaana-keyboard/blob/master/ThaanaKeyboard.js

Thanks @aharen

# Additional notes

DAM_Kalhi font sucks
